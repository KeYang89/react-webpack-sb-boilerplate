- [x] **Webpack (v.3.11.0) and Webpack Dev Server (v.2.9.5)** with Scope Hoisting enabled
- [x] Hot Module Replacement using [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [x] ES6 linting with continuous linting on file change
- [x] SASS support (See Preinstallation setting below)
- [x] Separate CSS stylesheets generation
- [x] Automatic HTML generation
- [x] Production Config

## Preinstallation setting
1. (Optional) To use sass directly, you can install Ruby on your machine (see 4)
- If you are using Windows, you can get Ruby here: https://rubyinstaller.org/
- In command line, run:
`gem install sass`
2. (Optional) You can also install sass using node:
`npm install -g sass`
3. (Optional) Command to convert sass to scss if you have Ruby gem installed
`sass-convert -R your_sass_dir --from sass --to scss`
4. How to solve potential **SSL issue** when install Ruby:
- In command line, run:
`gem sources -r https://rubygems.org/`
`gem sources -a http://rubygems.org/`


## Starting the dev server

Make sure you have the latest Stable or LTS version of Node.js installed.

1. Download or git clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Start the dev server using `npm start`
3. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Available Commands

- `npm start` - start the dev server
- `npm clean` - delete the dist folder
- `npm cache clean` - delete cache
- `npm run production` - create a production ready build in `dist` folder
- `npm run lint` - execute an eslint check
- `npm test` - run all tests
- `npm run test:watch` - run all tests in watch mode
- `npm run coverage` - generate code coverage report in the `coverage` folder

## Vendor Exporting

You can export specific vendors in separate files and load them. All vendors should be included in `app/vendors` and will be exported in a `vendors` folder under `dist`. The main idea is to serve independent JavaScript and CSS libraries, though currently all file formats are supported.

! Don't forget to add the vendors in `app/index.html` and `build/index.html`.

## Code Coverage

The project is using the Jest Code Coverage tool. The reports are generated by running `npm run coverage`. All configurations are located in `package.json`, inside the `jest` object.

The coverage report consists of an HTML reporter, which can be viewed in the browser and some helper coverage files like the coverage json and xml file.

## Production code

Run `npm run production`. The production-ready code will be located under `dist` folder.
